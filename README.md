This is a project from The Odin Project.

The task is to create the website from scratch, including the html and css.

The only thing provided is a screenshot of what the website needs to look like, and some specifics of the font and coloring. These images are included as the "Target Website".

Everything else is done by me and is a demonstration of what I know about HTML and CSS.
